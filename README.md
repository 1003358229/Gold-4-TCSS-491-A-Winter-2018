Game Comment:  
To be a successful tower defense  
you will want to include:  
1. as many towers and enemies as possible  
2. try to have multiple levels. Good luck.  
  
  
Minimal Deliverable Comment:  
It looks like you have the basics of a tower defense together.  
However you do not yet have a complete game.  
You have your tower assets but it is not clear that they are functionally different.  
(i.e. different damage, radius, fire rate, etc.)  
In addition you only have a single wave of enemies.  
You will need to have several stages of enemies to make the game challenging and fun to play.  
1. different damage, radius, fire rate, etc.  
2. several stages of enemies
