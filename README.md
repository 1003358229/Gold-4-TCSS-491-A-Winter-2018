What to do:  
1. Remove tower or sell tower function?  
2. we need to update the path and the exit of path has to be on the right or bottom because of the code  
3. search the key word: TODO in code(should there be an explotion animation for bullet and enemy death?)  
4. add level 1,2,3...+  
6. tower and enemy should be balanced so it can be played with more fun  
7. bullet animation should be with no directions  
8. too many towers that look the same and works the same way.(maybe slow tower, multi target tower?)  
  
Done:  
Fix score - hit for score, kill for money  
Give the towers their own firerate and damage, and maybe bullet  
Add 1-3 different types of dogs, with different health and speed  
No tower on path 
Add level counter   
Update map/path  (buggy kinda done)  
update the "game over" if statement to detect both x and y axis  
  
  
Game Comment:  
To be a successful tower defense  
you will want to include:  
1. as many towers and enemies as possible  
2. try to have multiple levels. Good luck.  
  
  
Minimal Deliverable Comment:  
It looks like you have the basics of a tower defense together.  
However you do not yet have a complete game.  
You have your tower assets but it is not clear that they are functionally different.  
(i.e. different damage, radius, fire rate, etc.)  
In addition you only have a single wave of enemies.  
You will need to have several stages of enemies to make the game challenging and fun to play.  
1. different damage, radius, fire rate, etc.  
2. several stages of enemies
