What to do:  
1. have different levels of game  
    1. (levels function done without add waves of enemy)  
    2. (exit of path has to be on the right or bottom)  
2. tower and enemy should be balanced so it can be played with more fun  
    1. tower price is balanced a bit  
3. bullet animation should be with no directions  
4. Remove tower or sell tower function?  
5. too many towers that look the same and works the same way.  
    1. (maybe slow tower, multi target tower?)  
6. search the key word: TODO in code
    1. an explotion animation for bullet and enemy death?  
  
Game Comment:  
To be a successful tower defense  
you will want to include:  
1. as many towers and enemies as possible  
2. try to have multiple levels. Good luck.  
  
  
Minimal Deliverable Comment:  
It looks like you have the basics of a tower defense together.  
However you do not yet have a complete game.  
You have your tower assets but it is not clear that they are functionally different.  
(i.e. different damage, radius, fire rate, etc.)  
In addition you only have a single wave of enemies.  
You will need to have several stages of enemies to make the game challenging and fun to play.  
1. different damage, radius, fire rate, etc.  
2. several stages of enemies
